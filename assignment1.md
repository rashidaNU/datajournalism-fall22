## Critique of ["Airbnb's Impact on San Francisco 2015"](https://www.sfchronicle.com/airbnb-impact-san-francisco-2015/#1)by the San Francisco Chronicle 

### Clarity and accuracy 
* Clear insight: 5 - The main insight communicated was the detriminental effects of Airbnb listings in San Francisco on housing scarcity. This was communicated in the headline and a short description following the first heading, "The Airbnb effect."
* Legibility: 3 - The data is legible in most instances, however, the font is corrupted at times, causing special characters to appear in the text. Further, the site seems to be more legible on mobile or in a smaller window.  In the full screen desktop version, headers overlap frequently. In terms of navigating the visualizations, it is intuitive and easy to go from chart to chart.  Still, I think it would be more effective to allow users to compare neighborhood data side by side to best demonstrate differences. 
* Was the data accurate?: 2 - The pie chart that demonstrates all super hosts in San Francisco appears to be inaccurate based upon what the article says about how listings are tracked. Renters do not report that their home is rented out as vacation rentals which means the numbers that indicate that 3,599 hosts own one property cannot be relied upon as they could own more without the city noticing to regulate. 
* Sources to check - 2015 shared room data is missing for price, locations and reviews. 
* Were sources provided? - The article listed the two data-extraction firms that harvested the data on three differennt websites, Airbnb, HomeAway and Flipkey.  However, the visualizations do not differentiate what data comes from which website. The article mainly focuses on Airbnb in its headline and description, but the data actually covers three websites in total. Still, readers are unable to click on source links or access the source data themselves. 
* Most charts were accompanied by little or unhelpful explanations. For example, the chart that compares rental services on part four shows the number of properties and average nightly costs of each rental service. However, the description only discusses the number of properties per service and types of listings (shared, entire home, room, etc.). 

### Quality 
* Rating: 3 - What this article does well is offer multiple and at times conflicting viewpoints on the issue.  For example, it includes the opinions of those who list their homes, members of the communties were the homes are located and the perspective of each rental service and how they vary in their view of hosts and their impact. 

### Type and color 
On parts three, four and five, large 2-D letters that become 3-D on hover block text and don't seem to serve a purpse. On the surface, the letters, which were placed at the beginning of the text, could catch readers' eyes, but the animation is only activated by hover.  I can't imagine a reason readers' cursors would be on that side of the page. 
* Type: 3 - The text type varies throughout the pages. In text boxes with colored backgrounds it appears to use Arial type while the page text uses a variation of Times/Times New Roman.
* Color: 1 - This article used green, teal and orange, colors that don't appear to match. It seems as though color was randomly selected. Further, charts used colors that were often pretty similar to one another, making it difficult to differentiate between one category and the other. Even so, I appreciated the emphasis the color provided because colored textboxes always summarized each part of the story or highlighted photo captions that offered interesting additional information.  

### Creativity 
* Rating: 3 - I do not find this piece particularly creative. There were creative elements (like the 2-D to 3-D letter activated by hover), but ultimately, those elements blocked the view of important text, making it overall hard to read.  This piece receives a three in creativeity because I believe the photos chosen added to the story.  Seeing reactions of residents impacted by these services brought the data to life and added a personal element. 

## Final Project Pitch
### Project Question: How significant is the national teacher shortage across the U.S.?

Ultimately, with to answer this question I hope to combine datasets from regions of the U.S. to demonstrate the teacher shortage on a national scale. Currently, no data exists in terms of how many teacher positions are empty across America. There are, however, datasets which showcase the teacher shortage on a local and state level.  My goal is to find data from each state and categorize the data by region.  It is unclear whether data for every single state is available, but I could also choose the top largest populated states in each region and use that data as an estimate for the region as a whole. 

This story is timely because schools across the nation are resuming classes. Futher, several states have for the first time implemented new strategies to cope with the shortage. In Ariznoa, for eample, a new law will allow college students to teacher classes. Meanwhile in Florida, veterans who have served for at least four years and have earned at least 60 college credits are being offered teaching jobs.  Several measures are being implemented, yet it is unclear how effective such measures are in filling jobs. 

I would hope to speak to superintendents as well as school administrators across various school districts in each region of the U.S. More importantly, I'd like to highlight the student and parent perspective, inquiring about their opinions on their state's plan to fill teacher positions. I'd imagine allowing unqualified individuals to instruct classes would be controversial and perhaps concerning for both students and parents.

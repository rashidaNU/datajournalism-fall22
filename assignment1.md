## Critique of "Airbnb's Impact on San Francisco 2015" by the San Francisco Chronicle

### Clarity and accuracy 
* Clear insight: 5 - The main insight communicated was the detriminental effects of Airbnb listings in San Francisco on housing scarcity. This was communicated in the headline and a short description following the first heading, "The Airbnb effect."
* Legibility: 3 - The data is legible in most instances, however, the font is corrupted at times, causing special characters to appear in the text. Further, the site seems to be more legible on mobile or in a smaller window.  In the full screen desktop version, headers overlap frequently. In terms of navigating the visualizations, it is intuitive and easy to go from chart to chart.  Still, I think it would be more effective to allow users to compare neighborhood data side by side to best demonstrate differences. 
*
* was the data accurate - 1-5
* list where you question accuracy 
* list sources to check - 2015 shared room data is missing for price, locations and reviews
* were sources provided - The article listed the two data-extraction firms that harvested the data on three differennt websites, Airbnb, HomeAway and Flipkey.  However, the visualizations do not differentiate what data comes from which website. The article mainly focuses on Airbnb in its headline and description, but the data actually covers three websites in total. 
* was everything explained

### Quality 
* 1-5, explain what was good and what could be improved 

### Type and color 
* did it belong, draw your eye to important info, make sense?
* type 1-5 explain
* color 1-5 explain

### Creativity 
* did the piece emphasize areas to draw someone in or add detail. or was it random visuals? 1-5

## Final Project Pitch
### Project Question: How significant is the national teacher shortage across the U.S.?

Ultimately, with to answer this question I hope to combine datasets from regions of the U.S. to demonstrate the teacher shortage on a national scale. Currently, no data exists in terms of how many teacher positions are empty across America. There are, however, datasets which showcase the teacher shortage on a local and state level.  My goal is to find data from each state and categorize the data by region.  It is unclear whether data for every single state is available, but I could also choose the top largest populated states in each region and use that data as an estimate for the region as a whole. 

This story is timely because schools across the nation are resuming classes. Futher, several states have for the first time implemented new strategies to cope with the shortage. In Ariznoa, for eample, a new law will allow college students to teacher classes. Meanwhile in Florida, veterans who have served for at least four years and have earned at least 60 college credits are being offered teaching jobs.  Several measures are being implemented, yet it is unclear how effective such measures are in filling jobs. 

I would hope to speak to superintendents as well as school administrators across various school districts in each region of the U.S. More importantly, I'd like to highlight the student and parent perspective, inquiring about their opinions on their state's plan to fill teacher positions. I'd imagine allowing unqualified individuals to instruct classes would be controversial and perhaps concerning for both students and parents.

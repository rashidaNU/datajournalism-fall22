Bad data Issues/solutions: 
At this stage of research, we know that 13 states have not or cannot report data on teacher vacancies.  Thus, values will be missing for some states.  We will need to investigate why each of these states have failed to or cannot upload this data. 

It is likely that we will run into natural/seasonal variations that skew the data on teacher employment across the country.  For instance, it is possible that teachers are hired after the start of school calendars.  To fix this issue, we can compare employment data from month to month or by season.
